# Email-Verifier
A Flask application to verify if the provided email exist or not.

# Working
The user is asked to input an email address and the server checks to see if the email address is valid and exists or not.
It is accomplished by communicating with the mail server of the domain provided in the mail and asking if the mail exists or not.
To avoid the mail server blocking the IP address for multiple requests, SOCKS proxy was used.

NOTE: Requirements.txt not present. You will have to pip install based on the imports.
Will upload soon.
